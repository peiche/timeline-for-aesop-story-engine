Timeline for Aesop Story Engine
============

Vertical timeline content for Aesop Story Engine.

A single timeline component is one event: designated by a date or time, usually. Using multiple components, create a timeline on any post or page.

Please note that this plugin builds upon existing functionality provided by Aesop Story Engine, and will not function without it.

##Options

Using the component's built-in options, timeline events can be customized with custom icons, colors, and images.

**Icon font class** defines the icon font and specific icon to use. WordPress comes bundled with [Dashicons](https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/); the default icon is a pencil, defined by `dashicons dashicons-edit`. If you are loading in another icon font, such as Font Awesome, you can specify its classes here instead.

**Color** defines the color behind the icon. The default is a neutral light gray. The icon's color will change depending on the color you choose here, to maintain readability.

**Icon color** overrides the default color of the icon. This is optional.

**Event title** is, of course, the title of this event in the timeline.

**Event description** can be as long or short as you like.

**Background image** is optional. Including it will slightly darken the entire event, and change the event text color from dark to light, to maintain readability.

**Event link** is optional.

**Link text** is optional. If you define an event link but no text, the entire event becomes clickable.

**Event time or date** should be pretty self-explanatory. It's a text field, not a datepicker, so you can define the specificity. Whether it's a time, a date, or a combination, it's completely up to you.
